## Legally scraping the web

**Is web scraping legal?** Generally speaking, if something is publicly accessible via the internet, you're allowed to view and use it. However, there are exceptions.

The US Court of Appeals has determined that scraping of public information is legal, even if a website's terms of service may prevent it. However, just because something may be accessed and scraped, doesn't mean you have an unlimited commercial right to do whatever you want with it. And in certain legal jurisdictions, you may require a legitimate reason to hold certain kinds of information in the first place - e.g. personally identifiable information (PII).

Dutch data regulators [have declared](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/actueel/ap-scraping-bijna-altijd-illegaal) that if the personal information of EU citizens is found amongst the data you're scraping, you may require their consent. They give examples of certain kinds of scraping which are "always prohibited" under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including:

- scraping the internet to create profiles of people and then resell them;
- scraping information from protected social media accounts or private forums;
- scraping data from public social media profiles, with the aim of determining whether or not people qualify for a certain kind of insurance.

This guidance (and GDPR rules more broadly) do not apply to "domestic use", as well as in certain other "exceptional" cases. For example:

- a private individual can scrape information (including PII) for a personal purpose (e.g. a hobby project), provided they then subsequently limit the collect information's distribution (e.g. to a few friends);
- a company can scrape personally identifiable information provided if it has a "legitimate interest" and the information scraped is used in a very targeted manner (e.g. an organization may scrape the websites of news media to gain insight into relevant news about its own company). Under most EU country's interpretations of GDPR, using PII to _make money_ is not considered to be a "legitimate interest", while protecting against loss (via reputation monitoring or fraud prevention) generally is.

**Obtaining consent to scrape PII.** Under GDPR, an individual may only consent to the collection of their personal data if explicitly asked in advance.

**Scraping non-PII.** Many kinds of information on the web do not contain PII. For example, product listings and their prices on a marketplace like Amazon. In other cases, scraped information may be deanonymized (e.g. customer names removed from reviews of a product that may appear online).

## Legally preventing scraping

As a user, you can attempt to assert your individual right to privacy, and any intellectual property rights you may hold (e.g. image rights, copyright). However, not all information you post online will necessarily be covered by these, and in any case it may be technically impossible to prevent others from scraping your information that appears online in the first place, if it's publicly accessible. You can, however, try to control what information appears online in the first place.

Meanwhile, as a website operator, you may expect that you have the right to prevent others scraping your website. This may often be true, but depending on the jurisdiction you're in, it may also not be universally the case. For example, in the US, depending on the circumstances, it may constitute "malicious interference with a contract" if you prevent one party from scraping your website, while at the same time not restricting the general availability of the information on it to others (see: [_HiQ v. LinkedIn_](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/19/scraping_public_data_linkedin/)). Current best-practice website operators can adopt to guard against scraping therefore includes:

- ensuring that information on your website which you wish to protect against scraping is only visible to authenticated users of your website with their own accounts;
- requiring new users agree to your website's terms of service upon sign up;
- stipulating in your terms of service that each individual may only hold one account, and forbidding the use of automated scraping agents and software.

However, making your website's content inaccessible to unauthenticated users may also mean pages don't appear in search results, limiting your website's reach, and many potential real visitors are deterred from accessing content on your website in the first place. You should determine whether or not this makes sense for you.
